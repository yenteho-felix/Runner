This endless runner challenges players to navigate dynamically generated environments using characters with unique abilities.

## Focus
* The project demonstrate the full game loop, featuring a main menu, asynchronous loading screens, character selection, dynamic map generation, and functionality for pausing, resuming, and restarting gameplay.
* Centralized settings for seamless replacement of characters, buildings, and spawn objects, making it easier to expand content.
* Developed in two versions: a Blueprint-based implementation and a fully optimized C++ rewrite for better performance and maintainability.
  
## Development
* Time frame: 8 Weeks
* Engine: Unreal Engine 5.4
* GitHub: https://github.com/yenteho-felix/Runner

## Future Expansion
* Each character has unique abilities that influence their movement and interaction with the environment.
* Each theme introduces distinct enemies designed to challenge players by slowing their progress or altering movement dynamics.
